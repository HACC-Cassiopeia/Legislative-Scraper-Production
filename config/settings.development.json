      "billPurpose": "Requires that eighth grade students and twelfth grade students in Hawaii public schools along with University of Hawaii undergraduate students plant trees.",
      "position": "The Hawaii State Department of Education (Department) offers the following comments on HB 410 regarding specific grade level mandate for tree planting. The Department agrees that educational endeavors around environmental protection, biodiversity, and climate change mitigation are critical for youth to cultivate science literacy and socially conscious citizenry and the Department is deeply committed to ‘āina-based education. To that end, the Department adopted the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in 2016. There is a clear trajectory of building developmentally appropriate student understanding of topics such as climate and human impacts on the environment from kindergarten through high school. In addition, climate change and other topics of human-environment interaction are specifically addressed in the Hawaii Core Standards for Social Studies. The Department’s school design strategy prioritizes a flexible and adaptive approach, empowering each school to make decisions about specific contexts and partnerships for developing high quality and relevant learning experiences based on the needs of their students and the local community. It is through this lens that schools are able to creatively address ‘āina-based educational programs and projects that promote environmental protection, biodiversity, and climate change mitigation. SUPERINTENDENT The Department recognizes that there are multiple approaches to building student scientific and environmental literacy and taking informed action on environmental issues. While planting trees is one such approach, the target rate of thirty trees planted by every 8th- and 12th-grade student, about 14,000 students per grade level, would be 840,000 trees to be planted each year. Knowing that approximately 68% of our student population is on Oahu, the logistics and space for tree planting at such a rate would need to be considered. Finally, discussions regarding how the Department can increase sustainability practices are already in motion. Recent considerations include a focus on how to enrich the landscape of the school grounds with the use of indigenous plants, replacing invasive plants and allowing for cultural teaching through ceremonial or food gardens. The Department is committed to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is contributing to the Hawaii 2050 Sustainability Plan. The Department respectfully requests that if HB 410 is passed, it does not replace the professional judgment for learning activities by our teachers and instructional leaders or adversely impact priorities approved by the Hawaii State Board of Education. The Department defers to the University of Hawaii regarding section 3 of the bill. Thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony on HB 410. The Hawai‘i State Department of Education is committed to delivering on our promises to students, providing an equitable, excellent, and innovative learning environment in every school to engage and elevate our communities. This is achieved through targeted work around three impact strategies: school design, student voice, and teacher collaboration. Detailed information is available at www.hawaiipublicschools.org.",
